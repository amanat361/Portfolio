Here are some good alternatives to common GNU tools that are faster and have better defaults.

**du → dust**  
`du` shows disk usage but the output is hard to parse. `dust` gives you a visual representation with colored bars that make it easy to see what’s eating your storage at a glance.

**ls → eza**  
`ls` lists files but it’s plain and limited. `eza` is a modernized version with colors, git status integration, tree views, and human-readable file sizes built in.

**tar → ouch**  
`tar` handles archives but the syntax is notoriously clunky. `ouch` is user-friendly and supports multiple formats with simpler commands that actually make sense.

**find → fd**  
`find` locates files but the syntax is verbose and unintuitive. `fd` is faster and simpler, supports regex, has color output, and better defaults without sacrificing power.

**grep → ripgrep**  
`grep` searches text but it’s slower on large codebases. `ripgrep` is blazing fast, optimized for code, respects .gitignore files, and supports richer options without complex flags.

**cd → zoxide**  
`cd` is basic directory navigation with no memory. `zoxide` is a smart directory jumper that remembers frequently used paths and lets you jump with fuzzy matching, reducing keystrokes.
